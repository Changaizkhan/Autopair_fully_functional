FAQS = """
❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

1. **What is a factory or manufacturer’s warranty?**  
Every new vehicle comes with a factory warranty that covers non-wear & tear parts. Once it expires, you’re on your own. Autopair fills that gap with extended coverage.

2. **Why not just get this from a dealer?**  
Dealers charge 2–3x more and force you to use specific repair centers. Autopair lets you choose your shop and buy directly — saving you thousands.

3. **I still have factory coverage. Why buy now?**  
You can defer Autopair coverage to begin right after your manufacturer warranty ends — up to 12 months in advance.

4. **My dealer gave me a 3-month warranty. What should I do?**  
You can still purchase Autopair and set it to start after the dealer plan ends.

5. **Can I transfer my plan if I sell the car?**  
Yes! Plans are fully transferable to the next owner. Just contact support.

6. **What happens during a breakdown?**  
Refer to the claims process: get a diagnosis, submit it, get approval, and choose your payment method (card or e-transfer).

7. **Are you better than other warranty companies?**  
Yes — we cut out middlemen, offer direct pricing, allow any licensed repair shop, and include $0 deductible on all plans.

8. **Can I cancel my plan?**  
Yes, within 10 days of purchase and no claims made. A $99 fee applies. After 10 days, plans are non-cancellable and non-refundable.

9. **Is there a limit to how many claims I can make?**  
No limit to the number of claims — but the max per claim is $3,000 (Standard) or $6,000 (Works), and total claim value cannot exceed the vehicle’s acquisition cost.

10. **Do I need to maintain the vehicle?**  
Yes. You must do oil + filter changes every 6 months or 12,000 km to keep coverage valid.

11. **Do I need an inspection to buy a plan?**  
No inspection is required to purchase. However, one is needed to process a claim.
